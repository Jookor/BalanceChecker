# BalanceChecker

Balance checker for headphones.

You can use this tool to check if the volume level is the same from both sides of headphones.

To use this you need a microphone and a pari of headphones.

It's really simple to use, just select audio file you want to use and start the check.

First put the other side of the headphones close to the microphone and the application tells you to change side, put the other side of the headphones to the microphone. After the test has run succesfully you get the result ok or fail.

It's that simple!
